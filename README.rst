django-crispy-forms is the new django-uni-form. django-uni-form was an application created by `Daniel Greenfeld`_ that I led since version 0.8.0. The name change tries to better explain the purpose of the application, which changed in a significant way since its birth.

If you are upgrading from django-uni-form, we have `instructions`_ for helping you.
